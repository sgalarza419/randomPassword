# randomPassword

This assignment required me to write a JavaScript code to randomly generate a password with 8-128 for a user of the site.  The user is to choose if the password is to contain numbers, symbols, upper and lowercase letters.  I used if, else if, and for loops to combine arrays and generate the passwords to the website.  The .concat function was used to combine the character type arrays into a combined array for extraction of the letters of the password.
